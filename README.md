# tektek
An http load test tool by.

**I am very beginner with crystal-lang** and **this is a demo project.**

And this means :

- Do not use for production
- You can fork this and improve
- Use with your own risk
- There may be lots of bugs. But feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/hasantayyar/tektek/issues/new).
- This project is not well documented.

There is some [super cool crystal projects](https://github.com/search?l=crystal&q=http&ref=simplesearch&type=Repositories&utf8=%E2%9C%93) if you want to check.
